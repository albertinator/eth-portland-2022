# trust.fund

## Description

During ETH Portland 2022, I implemented an irrevocable living trust account that has an age trigger for releasing wealth to a user's heir.

I wrote the contract code in Solidity, deployable to the ETH blockchain. I also built a frontend that lets a user:
* Set the terms of the trust (using web3.js to write to ETH blockchain)
* Display the terms and current balance of the trust (using web3.js to read from ETH blockchain)
* Fund the trust with fiat-to-crypto on ramp (powered by Transak)
* Attempt to transfer funds to the heir, which will fail if contract terms are not met (using web3.js to write to ETH blockchain)

Trust funds are an important part of estate planning and the transfer of wealth to heirs. In fact, in just the United States, there is about $2 trillion locked up in these old school contracts.

Trust funds today are implemented manually with a few unattractive ~~features~~ bugs:
* The involvement of 3rd party trustee, typically a financial instution that will charge 1-2% annually for holding the funds
* Up to $1K in legal fees to draft the conditions of a trust contract, depending on complexity of conditions of wealth transfer
* Possibly $10K to $100K in additional legal fees if there are disputes from ambiguous contract terms
* Up to $1K in tax accountant fees to advise, plan, or file on tax repercussions, depending on factors like state law or type of trust

How is the next $trillion that go into trust funds going to be handled? Through smart contracts and decentralized finance.

## Setup
Install Truffle
```bash
$ npm install -g truffle
```

Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache), to emulate ETH node with 10 accounts

This repo was initiated by running:
```bash
$ truffle unbox pet-shop
```
and then following [https://trufflesuite.com/tutorial](https://trufflesuite.com/tutorial)

## Backend
```bash
$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate
```

## Frontend
Set up [Metamask extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)

Connect Metamask to Ganache:
* [https://asifwaquar.com/connect-metamask-to-localhost](https://asifwaquar.com/connect-metamask-to-localhost)

Run the frontend:
```bash
$ yarn dev
```
